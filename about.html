		<h1>Decentralized Voting System using Blockchain</h1>
		<hr>

		<div>
			Blockchain is a technology that is rapidly gaining momentum in era of industry 4.0. With high security
			and transparency provisions, it is being widely used in supply chain management systems, healthcare,
			payments, business, IoT, voting systems, etc.
			<h3>Why do we need it?</h3>
			Current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting suffer from various security threats such
			as DDoS attacks, polling booth capturing, vote alteration and manipulation, malware attacks, etc, and also
			require huge amounts of paperwork, human resources, and time. This creates a sense of distrust among
			existing systems.
			Some of the disadvantages are:
			<ul>
				<li>Long Queues during elections.</li>
				<li>Security Breaches like data leaks, vote tampering.</li>
				<li>Lot of paperwork involved, hence less eco-friendly and time-consuming.</li>
				<li>Difficult for differently-abled voters to reach polling booth.</li>
				<li>Cost of expenditure on elections is high.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Solution:</h3>
			Using blockchain, voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable.
			Its also a fast and secure way to cast your vote.
